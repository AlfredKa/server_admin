The purpose of "./": The "./" at the beginning is used to specify the current directory as the location of the script. It tells the shell to look for the script in the current directory.

Purpose of "shebang": The shebang (#!/bin/bash) at the beginning specifies the interpreter to be used for running the script, which, in this case, is Bash. It ensures that the script is executed using the correct interpreter.

**Script 2: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers in Python**

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
num1 = 5
num2 = 10
sum = num1 + num2
print("The sum is:", sum)
```

Purpose of "./": In this case, "./" is not used because Python scripts are typically executed with the Python interpreter directly, like `python script.py`, so you don't need to specify the current directory.

Purpose of "shebang": The shebang (#!/usr/bin/python) specifies that this script should be run using the Python interpreter located at /usr/bin/python.

**Script 3: List Files in the Current Directory in Perl**

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
opendir(DIR, ".");
@files = readdir(DIR);
closedir(DIR);
foreach $file (@files) {
    print "$file\n";
}
```

To edit these scripts using Vim (a terminal-based text editor), you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where the scripts are located.

3. To edit a script, run:

   ```bash
   vim scriptname
   ```

   Replace "scriptname" with the name of the script you want to edit.

4. Use Vim commands to edit the script. For example, press `i` to enter insert mode, make your changes, and then press `Esc` to exit insert mode.

5. To save your changes and exit Vim, you can use the following commands:

   - Press `:` to enter command mode.
   - Type `wq` to write (save) and quit the editor
